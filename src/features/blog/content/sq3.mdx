Artificial intelligence has become one of the most decisive competitive tools in modern digital businesses.  
From customer support and sales to healthcare and retail communication, AI now directly influences **response speed, decision quality, safety, and customer satisfaction**.

**SQ3** applies these advances to business conversations—bringing structure, explainability, and human control to AI-assisted communication across web chat, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Why Traditional Business Messaging Breaks at Scale

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increasingly rely on digital messaging channels, yet most still operate with:

- Fragmented inboxes across platforms  
- Slow or missed replies  
- Lost complaints and refund requests  
- Inconsistent tone across staff  
- No visibility into customer satisfaction or escalation risk  

Manual handling does not scale, while fully automated chatbots introduce **hallucination, compliance risk, and loss of trust**.

SQ3 was designed specifically to solve this gap by treating conversations not as isolated messages, but as **continuous, governed interactions**.

---

## Sequence3: The Intelligence Layer Behind SQ3

At the core of SQ3 is **Sequence3**, a modular intelligence architecture that breaks AI decision-making into **clear, auditable responsibilities**.

Instead of relying on a single chatbot, SQ3 decomposes intelligence into specialised layers that collaborate while remaining independently observable and controllable.  
This allows the system to scale safely, adapt to real business conditions, and preserve human authority.

---

## OMNI: One Conversation Across All Channels

Customers do not think in platforms. They message on Instagram at night, follow up on the website in the morning, and expect continuity.

**OMNI** unifies conversations from Facebook, Instagram, and web chat into a **single continuous thread**, preserving full history and context.

This eliminates:
- Repeated questions  
- Lost context between channels  
- Friction caused by starting over  

Every downstream decision in SQ3 begins with the same shared conversation truth.

---

## Multi-Agent AI: The Core Intelligence of SQ3

Unlike single-bot systems, SQ3 uses a **multi-agent AI orchestration pipeline**, coordinated through Sequence3.

Each incoming message is processed through specialised intelligence components:

- **MEAN** – Identifies the underlying intent (inquiry, complaint, booking, refund) beyond keywords  
- **MOOD** – Tracks frustration-to-satisfaction in real time as a control signal  
- **LANG** – Detects Sinhala, English, and mixed-language input and responds naturally  
- **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)** – Pulls only tenant-approved information  
- **FAIR** – Evaluates AI outputs for bias, unsafe assumptions, or harmful content  
- **GATE** – Enforces role-based permissions and approval rules  

This design ensures AI **augments human teams instead of replacing them**.

---

## Satisfaction as a Control Signal, Not a Metric

A defining feature of SQ3 is the **Frustration-to-Satisfaction Index**.

Rather than treating sentiment as passive analytics, SQ3 uses it to **actively regulate AI autonomy**.

The system continuously evaluates:
- Emotional trends  
- Repetition of unresolved questions  
- Escalation language  
- Response delays  

When satisfaction drops below a configurable threshold, SQ3 **automatically disables AI replies and hands control to a human agent**, preventing escalation failures before they happen.

---

## Explainable AI by Design

Every AI-generated action in SQ3 is transparent and inspectable.

Workspace owners and agents can clearly see:
- Detected intent and confidence  
- Emotional trajectory over time  
- Knowledge sources used  
- Applied rules and guardrails  
- Explicit reasons for escalation, refusal, or handoff  

This makes SQ3 suitable for **regulated and high-stakes domains** such as healthcare, eCommerce, and retail.

---

## HIVE: Coordinated Intelligence, Not Chaos

At the centre of Sequence3 is **HIVE**, the orchestration layer that coordinates all intelligence signals.

HIVE combines:
- Conversation context (OMNI)  
- Emotional risk (MOOD)  
- Meaning and intent (MEAN)  
- Language handling (LANG)  
- Ethics and bias checks (FAIR)  
- Governance rules (GATE)  

Based on these signals, HIVE decides—**with full explanation**—whether AI can respond, whether human review is required, or whether immediate escalation is necessary.

## Conversation-Driven Marketing Intelligence (MARK)

SQ3 extends beyond support and operations.

With **MARK**, the platform builds **short-term customer segments** using only conversational behaviour, such as:
- Topics discussed  
- Intent patterns  
- Engagement frequency  

Customer memory operates on a **rolling 7-day window**, ensuring relevance while avoiding long-term profiling or invasive tracking.

This enables ethical, high-precision marketing grounded in real conversations.

---

## Built for Real Businesses, Not Just Demos

SQ3 is designed as a **multi-tenant SaaS platform**, providing:

- Strict tenant data isolation  
- Role-based access control  
- Domain-specific operational policies  
- Human-in-the-loop governance  
- Full auditability and compliance readiness  

The system is currently in the **design and architecture phase**, supported by a complete SRS, use cases, DFDs, sequence diagrams, and scenario-based evaluations.
