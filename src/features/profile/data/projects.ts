    description: `SQ3 is an **ongoing Software Development Group Project (SDGP)** focused on building a domain-aware, multi-tenant conversation management system for SMEs.

The platform unifies **website chat, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram DMs** into a single intelligent inbox, powered by a **multi-agent AI orchestration layer** with strong governance and human oversight.

**Core Capabilities:**

- Unified inbox for web, Facebook, and Instagram conversations  
- Intent detection, sentiment analysis, and real-time satisfaction scoring  
- Multi-agent AI pipeline (classification, reasoning, retrieval, guardrails, routing)  
- Human-in-the-loop control for sensitive, complex, or high-risk interactions  
- Explainable AI with transparent reasoning, rules, and evidence traces  
- Appointment and service booking workflows  
- Conversation-driven customer segmentation for marketing insights  

**Technical & Architectural Highlights:**

- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with strict tenant isolation  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation using tenant-specific knowledge bases  
- Domain-aware guardrails for healthcare, eCommerce, and retail  
- Satisfaction-based AI autonomy control with automatic human handoff  
- Designed using design-science methodology and scenario-based evaluation  

**Project Status:**
- Currently in **design & architecture phase** with detailed SRS, use cases, DFDs, and system diagrams  
- Implementation and pilot deployment planned as future work  

SQ3 is designed to **augment human agents**, not replace them—balancing automation, safety, transparency, and real-world business needs.`,
